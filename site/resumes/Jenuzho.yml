    summary: |
      I'm Jen Uzho. Although my carrer started in photography,
      I've recently shifted my passion toward the digital sector.
      Earlier this year, I worked in Texas in the insurance insdustry, 
      which allowed me to understand the importance of data in business.
      Upon returning to Spain, I decided to pursue studies in Data Science 
      to seize these opportunities and apply my expiricence 
      to combine my creativity with data analysis to drive innovation in tech starups
